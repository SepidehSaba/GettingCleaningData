    Values of Varible `Activity` consist of data from “Y_train.txt” and “Y_test.txt”
    values of Varible `Subject` consist of data from “subject_train.txt” and subject_test.txt"
    Values of Varibles `Features` consist of data from “X_train.txt” and “X_test.txt”
    Names of Varibles `Features` come from “features.txt”
    levels of Varible `Activity` come from “activity_labels.txt”

So we will use `Activity`, `Subject` and `Features` as part of descriptive variable names for data in data frame.
